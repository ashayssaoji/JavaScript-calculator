Certainly! Below is a README file that describes the code you've provided and how to use it:

## Calculator Web App
Overview
This is a simple web-based calculator application built using HTML5 and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations and evaluate mathematical expressions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started


Clone this repository to your local machine.

Created the index.html file where all my HTML code for the web page will be written. Similarly created Javascript folder Json folder and SCSS folders and made the files in them accordingly.  

To use this calculator, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

The calculator interface will be displayed, and you can start performing calculations.

## Features
Calculator Buttons
The calculator interface consists of various buttons, each representing a different function or operation. The buttons include numbers (0-9), mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, %), parentheses (,), clear (C), backspace (Back), decimal point (.), and the equal (=) button for evaluating the expression.

## User Input Display
The user's input expression is displayed in the top-right corner of the calculator. As you click buttons, your input expression will be shown here.

## Calculation Outcome
The calculation outcome is displayed immediately below the input expression. When you click the "=" button, the calculator evaluates the expression and displays the result here.

## Error Handling
The calculator is designed to handle invalid expressions gracefully. If you input an invalid expression or attempt to perform a calculation that results in an error, the calculator will display an "Invalid Expression" message.

## How to Use
Click on the buttons to input numbers and mathematical operators for your expression.

Use parentheses to group parts of your expression.

Click "=" to calculate the expression and see the result.

Click "C" to clear the input and result.

Click "Back" to remove the last character from your input or clear the result.

Click "." to insert a decimal point for floating-point numbers.

The calculator follows the order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS).

## Code Structure
The project's code is structured as follows:

index.html: The main HTML file that displays the content and includes the JavaScript file.

scss/index.scss: The main Sass file that contains styles for the application.

js/index.js: The JavaScript file that handles the functionality of the application, including blog expansion, creation, and updating.
